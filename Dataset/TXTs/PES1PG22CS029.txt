A plane that can take off and land vertically, without using a runway, is referred to as a VTOL
(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft. More flexibility in aircraft operations is made
possible by this capability, which is particularly beneficial for military and rescue operations
as well as for air transportation in cities. VTOL aircraft come in a variety of designs, including
as tiltrotor, tiltwing, and vectored thrust. In order to enable both vertical takeoff and landing
and horizontal flying, tiltrotor aircraft have rotors that can tilt between the vertical and
horizontal positions. Whereas vectored thrust aircraft utilise engines that can tilt to adjust the
direction of thrust, tiltwing aircraft feature wings that can tilt between the vertical and
horizontal positions.
When we think of an aircraft, we typically picture a pilot as the person in charge of flying it
manually. Now that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have made significant
strides, it is conceivable to have an aircraft that is entirely operated by AI. Yet, there is a flight
control mechanism to help the pilot even in a human-controlled aircraft. Although the flight
control system does the most of the work, a pilot is still required to operate the aircraft to its
maximum potential. This kind of flight aid system functions more like a flight control system.
A real flight control system does not require any input from the pilot while the aircraft is in
flight. This maintains the drone's balance while in flight. Even with this, a human pilot can
only maintain control of the drone for a very short time; this is where the flight controller
comes into play. While the pilot directs the drone in various directions—left, right, up, and
down—the flight control system is constantly providing guidance to keep the drone from
colliding. Assuming the drone is being turned left by the operator, the drone will not turn if
the angle is exceeded. Military and defence applications have pushed the development of
VTOL technology, with many nations investing considerably in research and development.
But, the civilian sector is also seeing an increase in applications, particularly in the fields of
logistics and transportation. Urban air mobility is being developed by businesses like Uber and
Airbus, and it has the potential to revolutionise urban travel. Overall, VTOL technology has
the ability to transform the aviation sector and present fresh opportunities for future logistics
and transportation.
