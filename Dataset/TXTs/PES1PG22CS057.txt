Summary of VTOL
VTOL stands for Vertical Take-Off and Landing, and refers to a type of aircraft that is able to take off and land
vertically, without the need for a runway or other infrastructure. This is accomplished through the use of
rotors or jet engines that can be tilted to provide lift and propulsion in any direction.
VTOL aircraft have a number of advantages over traditional fixed-wing aircraft, including the ability to
operate in areas where there is no runway or other infrastructure, and the ability to hover in place for
extended periods of time. They are commonly used in military applications such as reconnaissance and air
support, as well as in civilian applications such as search and rescue, emergency medical transport, and
transportation of goods.
There are several types of VTOL aircraft, including helicopters, tiltrotors, and vertical takeoff and landing
(VTOL) jets. Each type has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and is suited to different types of
missions and environments.
