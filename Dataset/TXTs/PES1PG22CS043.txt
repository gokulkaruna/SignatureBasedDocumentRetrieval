The Hindustan times reports that the Congress party is holding a day-long satyagraha to
protest the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from the Lok Sabha after he was convicted
in a 2019 defamation case. Rahul Gandhi challenged the government on the Adani issue,
saying that PM Modi is scared of his next speech on Adani, and thanked opposition
parties for their support. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and general secretary
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are sitting in the satyagraha at Raj Ghat in New Delhi, and all
Pradesh Congress Committees have been asked to organize a day-long satyagraha in front
of Gandhi statues. The Congress plans to approach a higher court to contest the Surat
court's order that sentenced Rahul Gandhi to two years' imprisonment.
The article further highlights that the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
successfully launched its largest Launch Vehicle Mark-III (LVM3) rocket, carrying 36
