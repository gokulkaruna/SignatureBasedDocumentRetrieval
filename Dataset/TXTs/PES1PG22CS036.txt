The report discusses the potential of eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing) in the
aviation industry and how the combination of AI and machine learning can benefit this
industry.
The basic components of eVTOLs are batteries, electric motors, and sensors like LIDAR,
radars, ultrasonic, and electronic controllers.
The report also highlights the use of machine learning algorithms like neural networks in
detecting, identifying, recognizing, classifying, locating objects, and predicting their
movement.
The report discusses how machine learning can be used to avoid collision in eVTOLs, which
will rely on a navigation system based on multiple cameras and LIDAR.
The report also highlights the use of machine learning in improving eVTOLs' performance
and measuring their experience by capturing images using LIDAR and sensor readings.
Furthermore, the report describes the potential use cases of eVTOLs in the market today, such
as forecasting traffic congestion in real-time and determining optimal landing locations.
It also discusses how machine learning can assist in continuous scanning of the sky for airborne
hazards and traffic, precision landing, and providing critical insights.
Overall, the report suggests that the integration of AI and machine learning in eVTOLs can
lead to safer and more efficient air transportation.
