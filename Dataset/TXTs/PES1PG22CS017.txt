A vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft is a vehicle that can depart, hover and land
vertically. VTOL aircraft have the ability to take off and land vertically as well as hover, fly
slowly and land in small spaces. Modern UAVs have their own limitations in terms of flight
range and maneuverability, with traditional fixed-wing UAVs requiring runways or wideopen spaces for take-off and landing, while multirotor UAVs are extremely manoeuvrable
but cannot be used for long-distance flights. Early UAVs were divided into two types, Fixed
Wing UAV (FWUAV) and Rotorcraft UAV (RUAV). EVTOL is a hybrid Vertical-TakeOff-Landing (VTOL) aircraft that can bridge the performance gap between RUAVs and
FWUAVs. It has multiple motors to maximize efficiency and safety, and is being fine-tuned
to bring alive the concept of UAM. The tilt-rotor mechanism is only one of the concepts that
have been proven for successful VTOL flights, and other concepts are being explored to
incorporate into similar hybrid VTOL aircraft's. VTOL machinery is a key element to ensure
the VTOL capability of the four motors with rotary blade stability to lift the load.
