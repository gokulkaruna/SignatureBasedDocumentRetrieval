SRN: PES1PG22CS018
The Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) secured their first victory of the Indian Premier
League (IPL) 2022 season by defeating the Mumbai Indians (MI) by six wickets at the
Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. RCB won the toss and elected to field first. The Mumbai
Indians got off to a shaky start, losing their first three wickets within the first six overs.
However, a brilliant partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan helped MI
recover and post a respectable total of 167 runs for the loss of seven wickets in their 20 overs.
In reply, RCB started off confidently, with openers Devdutt Padikkal and Virat Kohli putting
on a solid partnership of 51 runs. Despite losing a few wickets in the middle overs, RCB were
always in control of the chase, thanks to some excellent batting from Faf du Plessis and Glenn
Maxwell. Du Plessis was particularly impressive, scoring an unbeaten 55 off just 33 balls.
RCB eventually reached their target with two balls to spare, winning the match by six wickets.
The win will be a huge confidence booster for RCB, who had lost their first two matches of
the season. Virat Kohli was named the player of the match for his captaincy and his
contribution of 41 runs in the RCB innings. With this win, RCB move up to sixth place in the
IPL 2022 points table, while MI remain in eighth place.
