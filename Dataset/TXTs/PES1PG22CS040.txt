Cumulative foot pressure image is a technique that has been researched in recent years as a way to
identify individuals in video surveillance systems. This technique works by analyzing the pressure
distribution on the ground when a person walks, which can be captured using specialized sensors
embedded in the floor or footwear. By analyzing the pressure distribution over time, it is possible to
create a unique "footprint" for each individual, which can be used to identify them in subsequent
video footage. This technique has several advantages over other identification methods, such as
facial recognition, as it is less affected by changes in lighting and posture, and is less susceptible to
spoofing or impersonation. However, there are also some limitations to using cumulative foot
pressure image summary for identity recognition. For example, it requires specialized sensors or
footwear, which can be expensive and difficult to install. Additionally, it may not be suitable for
crowded areas or areas with high foot traffic, as it may be difficult to accurately track individual
footprints. Overall, while cumulative foot pressure image summary shows promise as a way to
improve identity recognition in video surveillance systems, more research is needed to address its
limitations and to determine its effectiveness in real-world applications.
