Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have been a topic of much interest and investment in
recent years. These aircraft promise to revolutionize urban air mobility by providing a fast, efficient, and
environmentally friendly way to travel short distances within cities. In this article, we will take a closer look
at how eVTOL aircraft work and what makes them unique.
First, it is important to understand that eVTOL aircraft are a type of electric aircraft that use electric motors
to power rotors or propellers. These aircraft have no traditional combustion engines or jet turbines, and they
rely solely on batteries for power. This makes them much quieter and more environmentally friendly than
traditional aircraft.The design of eVTOL aircraft is also unique. They typically have multiple rotors or
propellers that allow for vertical takeoff and landing, as well as forward flight. This means that eVTOL aircraft
can take off and land in much smaller spaces than traditional aircraft, making them ideal for urban
environments.
There are two main types of eVTOL aircraft: multicopters and tiltrotors. Multicopters have multiple rotors
that are fixed in place and can rotate independently to control the aircraft's movement. Tiltrotors, on the other
hand, have rotors that can tilt to provide both vertical and forward thrust.
