VTOL (Vehicle Takeoff and Landing) is a concept that refers to the ability of an aircraft take
off and land vertically without requiring a runway. In the context of machine learning, the
VTOL problem statement involves developing algorithms and models to enable an aircraft to
achieve stable and controlled vertical takeoff and landing. The goal of a VTOL machine
learning system is to enable the aircraft to safely and accurately perform vertical takeoff and
landing in a wide range of scenarios, including in high winds, low visibility, and other
challenging conditions. Achieving this goal requires advanced algorithms and models that can
process large amount of sensor data in real - time and make precise control decisions based on
that data.

To achieve this, the model would need to take inputs from various sensors and information
sources, such as the drone's position that velocity, wind speed, altitude, battery level and
camera feeds. The model would then use this information to predict the optimal actions to take
in real-time, such as adjusting the drone's thrust, pitch roll and yaw. This can be formulated as
a supervised learning problem where a labeled dataset of drone movements and sensor inputs
1s used to train a model. Alternatively, it can be framed as a reinforcement learning problem
where the model learns through trial and error by receiving feedback signals or rewards for
each action taken.

Overall, the VTOL problem as a machine learning task requires a combination of sensor
fusion, control theory, and optimization algorithms to ensure safe and effective operation of
the drone.

Dependability is the key driver for the megatrend towards autonomous driving. The future car
is fully connected and always online. It is all electronic and autonomous. The increased need
for safe electric systems in vehicles that drivers and passengers can rely on his the foundation
of trust and shapes the future towards higher levels of automated driving. Winning the trust of
tommorow's passangers starts with dependable electronics that enable highly available,
dependable, robust, safe and secure systems that operate in all conditions.
