This report discusses the concept of autonomous personal air vehicles (APAVs), specifically
electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. It explains that eVTOLs use electric
power and multiple electric motors to power propellers and wings for takeoff, landing, and
flying.
The report then goes on to discuss the potential applications of machine learning in the
eVTOL market, including weather forecasting, traffic congestion analysis, optimal landing
location determination, real-time dispatching and routing decisions, precision landing, and
air traffic control.
The report also mentions the potential markets for eVTOLs in agriculture, emergency medical
services, and logistics. The learning outcomes of the report are that machine learning is an
important aspect of VTOL and can be used to create new products and changes in the VTOL
and eVTOL sector while reducing labour and costs.
The report advises that manufacturers should consider various factors, such as cost, distance,
and charging, when creating successful products and maintain monitoring to make necessary
adjustments and improve over time.
