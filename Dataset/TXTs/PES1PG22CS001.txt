The article discusses the Internet of Things (IoT), which refers to internet-connected objects that collect and
transfer data without human intervention. IoT devices can provide data and insights to streamline workflows,
automate processes, meet compliance requirements, and compete more effectively in a changing business
environment. The four main components of IoT are low-power embedded systems, cloud computing, big data,
and networking connection. The article proposes a model to make farming more attractive by using available
technologies to help farmers decide on crops, maintain their land, and sell crops at proper prices. However,
farmers need to be trained and made aware of these technologies. India's agriculture industry uses various
farming systems, including subsistence, organic, and mechanical farming, and is highly dependent on the
monsoon cycle for large crop yields. India is the second-largest producer of various crops and has the largest
number of animals in the world. The article also notes that farmers in India tend to follow traditional methods
of farming and rely on luck for crop yields and market prices.
