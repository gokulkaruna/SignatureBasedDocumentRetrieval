Autonomous Personal Air-Travel Vehicles (APAVs), also known as Vertical Take-Off and
Landing (VTOL) aircraft, are vehicles that can depart, hover, and land vertically. They can be
powered by electric motors or batteries instead of fuel, making them more cost-effective and
flexible, as they can land almost anywhere.
To develop a model to control a flying vehicle for safe, efficient, and autonomous travel in urban
environments, a well-posed machine learning problem should be defined. The task is to create
an algorithm that allows the vehicle to fly autonomously based on its own sensors,
environmental data, and previous learning experience. The performance of the model can be
evaluated by measuring its ability to transport a passenger safely and efficiently while
minimising travel time and energy consumption. The experience can be broken down into
perception, planning trajectory, and managing. The algorithm should be trained using
supervised and reinforcement learning methods, with training data including different flight
scenarios.
Machine learning algorithms can be used to optimise eVTOL flight control systems, leading to
increased safety, decreased energy use, and improved flying stability. Predictive maintenance
can be achieved by analysing data acquired by eVTOL sensors to forecast component failures
before they occur. Resource management, such as battery life, energy use, and cargo capacity,
can also be improved with machine learning.
In conclusion, machine learning in eVTOLs can result in better performance, higher safety, and
lower prices, increasing the viability of these aircraft as a transportation option in the future.
