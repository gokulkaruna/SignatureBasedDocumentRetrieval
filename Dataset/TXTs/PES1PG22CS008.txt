This report discusses the design and operation of Autonomous Personal Air Travel Vehicles
(APAV), also known as eVTOL aircraft, which use electric power to take off and land
vertically. The report outlines the considerations involved in designing an APAV, such as
size, weight, propulsion, avionics, and control systems. It also discusses the critical aspects
of APAV's safe and efficient operation, such as flight planning, navigation, and
communication. The report defines the machine learning problem for an APAV, which
involves designing an algorithm to ensure collision avoidance in a non-deterministic
environment using real-time data from sensors and navigation systems. The report
concludes that further advancements in technology and continued research in machine
learning have the potential to revolutionise the transportation industry.
The key learning outcomes for an eVTOL learning problem involve developing domain
knowledge required to design, implement and maintain a system in a complex and
non-deterministic environment. This includes understanding the challenges associated with
eVTOL, collecting and processing raw data from various sensors and external sources, and
deploying a trained model that is scalable, available, and reliable. The model should also be
continuously monitored to make necessary updates and improvements over time.
