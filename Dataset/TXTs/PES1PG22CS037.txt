The following is the summary generated by Chat_GPT for the input of Assignment-1.
The article discusses the concept of autonomous personal air travel vehicles
(APAM) known as eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) and their applications. The
article breaks down the concept into three questions: what is APAM, why is it needed, and
how is it developed and designed. The article explains that eVTOL is designed for personal
transportation that can fly through the air without the need for a pilot or operator. The article
goes on to list the purposes of eVTOL, which include transportation, search and rescue,
agriculture, and medical emergencies. The article also discusses the challenges of eVTOL,
particularly the need for a collision avoidance system to ensure passenger and package
safety.
The article explains how machine learning can be applied to eVTOL and describes a
well-posed machine learning problem for eVTOL, which involves the task of safely traveling
from source to destination, the performance measure of the percentage of packages delivered
and customer satisfaction, and the training experience of learning from obstacles encountered
during travel. The article concludes by highlighting the role of machine learning in
technology and innovation and its potential to solve problems, increase time efficiency, and
improve safety.
