Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) refers to the ability of an aircraft to take off and land vertically without
the need for a runway or any external support. This means that the aircraft can lift off directly from the ground
or any other flat surface and can land in the same way, without requiring any forward speed or landing gear.
The most common types of aircraft that use vertical takeoff and landing capabilities are helicopters, tiltrotor
aircraft, and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft. These types of aircraft use different mechanisms to
achieve vertical flight.
Helicopters use a rotor blade to generate lift and propulsion, allowing them to hover in place and maneuver in
any direction. Tiltrotor aircraft, on the other hand, use rotors that can tilt, allowing them to take off and land
like a helicopter, but then transition to a more efficient airplane mode for forward flight. VTOL aircraft
typically use jet engines or other propulsion systems to generate lift and forward motion, allowing them to
take off and land vertically. aircraft have a number of advantages over traditional fixed-wing aircraft, including
the ability to operate in confined spaces, the ability to operate from remote locations or ships, and the ability
to quickly respond to emergencies or other time-critical situations. However, they also tend to be more
complex and expensive to operate and maintain than traditional aircraft.
They are several solutions that have been proposed to address these challenges in designing an autonomous
air travel taxi
Tilt-rotor technology: This involves using rotors that can tilt from a Vertical to a horizontal position, allowing
the aircraft to takeoff and land like a helicopter, but fly like a fixed wing aircraft. The V-22 osprey is an
example of an aircraft that uses tilt-rotor technology.
Thrust vectoring: This involves using variable geometry nozzles on the engines to direct the thrust in different
directions, allowing the aircraft to control its pitch, roll, and yaw. The F-35B Lightning II is an example of an
aircraft that uses thrust vectoring.
Lift-fan technology: This involves using a fan or set of fans to provide lift, while the engine provides thrust
for forward flight. The Harrier Jump Jet is an example of an aircraft that uses lift-fan technology.
