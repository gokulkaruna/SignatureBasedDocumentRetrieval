It sounds like the Health Consultant application is a very useful and convenient tool for
patients to access medical advice and treatment. By automating the process, patients no
longer have to wait in line for appointments, physically visit doctors' offices, or carry around
physical documents. Instead, they can easily access their medical information and interact
with medical consultants from the comfort of their own homes.
The five modules of the application seem well-designed and cover all the necessary aspects
of patient care, from registration and login to doctor details and prescription management.
The admin module is particularly important as it allows authorized personnel to manage all
patient and medical information.
Overall, the Health Consultant application seems like a great solution to improve access to
medical care and make it more convenient for patients.
